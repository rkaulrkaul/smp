We believe in creating high quality products that not only feel good using but also feel safe using. This
Jars: Our beautiful jars are made in the United States
Wax: The wax in our candles are 100% soy. Compared to paraffin, a petroleum-based wax used frequently in many candles, our candles burn cleaner and safer.
Fragrances: We use only phthalate-free fragrances in our candles. While there hasn’t been much research into the effects of fragrances with phthalates on air quality, we recognize our commitment to a superior product requires us to keep moving towards a higher level of ingredient quality and transparency.

Our Candles:
Hazelnut Chai- This candle envelopes your home in warm spicy cinnamon and tea notes, with middle notes of tea, hazelnut and a lingering, creamy finish.
Lavender London Fog- One of the first candles conceived, our Lavender London Fog candle springs awake with beautiful lavender, and bergamot top notes, followed by warm bracing black tea, and vanilla middle notes, and finished off with base notes of cream and honey.
Tobacco & Sage Leaf- Tobacco & Sage Leaf is a distinctly sensual aroma that’s rich with herbal, slightly grassy sage top notes, rich, full-bodied black tea and pipe tobacco middle notes, and balanced with sweet vanilla base notes.
Honey Chamomile Tea – A founder favorite, this beautiful, calming fragrance, has delicate floral top notes with middle notes of white tea and honey, with a light, almost powdery finish reminiscent of sweet fresh pollen.
Blackberry Green Tea – This fruity candle is bursting with top notes of fresh blackberry, tempered with slightly grassy green tea middle notes and a lingering, slightly jam-like base note.
Jasmine Green Tea – This candle sports a delicate, yet potent fragrance, providing heady floral top notes, a robust, complex green tea note, with just a trace of citrusy lemon.
Chantilly Cream – Designed to smell  mouth-watering and luscious, this vanilla candle boasts a potent, complex vanilla scent, with lightly floral honey notes, and a creamy, indulgently buttery base note.
