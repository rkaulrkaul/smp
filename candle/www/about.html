      <h4> Who We Are </h4>
      <p>
        Started in 2018 by Angela Lindsay, Copper Lotus Candles deals in more than just candles; we deal in experiences. Our core mission is to create warm, revitalizing environments, not just for our customers, but also for people that our light reaches. We believe in utilizing safe, high quality materials, to create products youâ€™ll love, to contribute to a bottom line that we share with non-profits, charities, and grass roots organizations. Additionally, all of our products and ingredients are safe for children. To learn more about the ingredients and safety of our products, click <a href="products.html#seven">here</a>.
      </p>

      <h4> Charitable Giving </h4> 
      <p>
        Our current charity is the local Ithaca Advocacy Center, whose mission is "to increase the safety and reduce the trauma for those who have been impacted by domestic violence, sexual assault, rape and child sexual abuse. Our trained advocates and volunteers work to provide high quality, trauma informed services guided by the needs of each person we serve.

        Services are all free, confidential* and provided regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, age, race, ethnicity, religious belief, ability level or immigration status." (Source: <a href=" http://www.theadvocacycenter.org/services/">http://www.theadvocacycenter.org/services/</a>)
