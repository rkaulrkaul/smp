## Contract Terms

**Your group contract/working agreement should include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. To what goals do we all commit?
We should all respect each others thoughts and opinions about the website. Everyone should put 100% of their effort into working on this project. We should be mindful of the deadlines and guidelines given to us. We should work to communicate effectively and efficiently to the best of our ability.


2. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)
 - Communicate frequently, especially when working on the repo so we can avoid merge conflicts!
 - Be respectful of differing opinions
 - Keep a positive attitude.


3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?
- Meet about once a week, preferably on Sundays.


4. How will we communicate and work with our client?
- Samantha can be the first contact to communicate and work with our client. She will meet with him seperately and record meeting minutes. These meetings will be reported to the rest of the group so that the website meets the wants/needs of the client. We will respect what the client has to say about our website and respond accordingly to feedback.


5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.
- We feel like we should all take part in each part of the assignment. Once we have our webpage designed, we will all be responsible for seeing at least one page to completion.


6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?
We will have set goals and timelines for finishing up on parts of the project in advance. That way, if a team member does not contribute in time, we can discuss reasons and possible solutions.


7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?
- We should communicate our issues as soon as possible to resolve them quickly.


8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?
We will just meet together and talk about what we need to re-visit in the contract.


10. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)
When we are done with the project we will celebrate by making a trip to the dairy bar!


## How to Use This Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract. If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info2300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?"
