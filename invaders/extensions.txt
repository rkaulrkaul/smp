Added extension for creating additional waves:

This is done by creating new wave objects after one wave is completely destroyed in app.py. In addition,
the next wave will have a faster speed than the wave before it. This speed continues until it stops at a
certain playable speed. The speed is adjusted in wave.py and is an attribute of the wave class.

Added extension for scoring:

This is done by creating new score attributes in app.py and wave.py. If an alien object is destroyed in
a wave, a certain amount of points will accumulate. These points will depend on how far the alien is from
the ship, with farther aliens rewarding more points. These points accumulate in the wave class, and the
score attribute in app.py contains the total points for the game. The score attribute in app.py is used to
create a GLabel object, which shows up on the top right of the screen. Once a new wave is created, the score
attribute for wave.py is reset, while score attribute for app.py is not reset. This maintains scores across
waves until the game ends.
